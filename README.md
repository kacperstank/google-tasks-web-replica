## üìã **What and Why?**

A feature-rich **Google Tasks-inspired web app**, built with modern web technologies. It includes core task management features like adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks while adhering to **Material 3 design principles**.

This project reflects my passion for Material 3 design and the clean, intuitive aesthetics of Google‚Äôs ecosystem. Since a young age, I have explored custom ROMs and admired the stock Android and Google UI feel, which continues to inspire me to build projects that embrace this design philosophy.
